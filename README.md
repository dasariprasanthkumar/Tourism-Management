## Tour Management System

Visitors used to have to manually look for available lodging in the locations they wanted to visit. They also needed to make reservations. People rarely knew anything about the history of the area or which sites were worth viewing. This process wasted electricity and a lot of time.

These guests' lives have been greatly simplified by the Tour Reservation System, which has saved them time and effort. Visitors ask for a plan to see if the selected tour package is still available. The Tour Information System contains this data. The customer's status will be verified by the system. When reserving, the new user will input his personal information and tour details. He or she will then receive a password and system-generated unique ID. This login credentials may be utilized for additional transactions.

Once the buyer is happy with the tour package, he or she will ask for a tour reservation. The personal information of a new client is kept in cust_info, while the information about the trip that the consumer specifically chose is kept in tour_info and is reorganized in the trip Information System.

Current customers can amend their personal information in cust_info, cancel their tour reservation from tour_info, and have changes made to their information reflected in the Tour Information System.

The consumer will either pay online or in person at the office after the trip package has been confirmed. The customer has three options for payment: cash, credit card, or check.

System verifies staff members' legitimacy. After the customer completes the payment, authorized personnel will create the ticket reservation system.

Customers who have made reservations can access reservation details by logging in with their cust_info and tour_info system login credentials. Through the Tour Information System, the administrator can add, remove, or change tour schemes.
