<h2>
Named as one of the ten paradises of the world by National Geographic <br>
Traveler, Kerala is famous especially for its ecotourism initiatives and <br>
beautiful backwaters. Its unique culture and traditions, coupled with its varied demography, <br>
have made Kerala one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world.<br>
<pre>Kerala, located on the south-western tip of India, enjoys unique geographical<br> features that have made it one of the most sought-after tourist destinations in Asia. Fondly referred to as ‘God’s Own Country’, Kerala was selected by the National Geographic <br>Traveller as one of the 50 destinations of a lifetime and one of the thirteen paradises in the world.

An equable climate, serene beaches, tranquil stretches of backwaters, lush hill stations<br> and exotic wildlife are the major attractions of this land.  A unique advantage of Kerala is that most of the destinations here are only a two - four hour drive from the other.

Classical art forms, colourful festivals, exotic cuisine are some of the cultural marvels <br>that await travellers. Ayurveda, the ancient Indian system of medicine and Panchakarma, the rejuvenation <br>therapy in Ayurveda have also helped Kerala to gain a pan-global reputation as a worth-visit destination.

Season never ends in Kerala, thanks to the year-long moderate climate and numerous festivals and events<br></h2>
